# ImageJ Workshop at MountSinai
I gave a 2-hour workshop at Icahn School of Medicine in December 2015. Creating this site to put my presentation slides.  
All the macros I demoed are also provided. All the images needed for running these macros could be found in the data directory.  
Here is the flyer for the workshop:
