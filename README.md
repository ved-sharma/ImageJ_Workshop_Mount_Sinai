# ImageJ/Fiji Workshop at Mount Sinai
I gave this two-hour workshop at the Microscopy Core and Advanced Bioimaging Center of Icahn School of Medicine in December 2015. Creating this site to put my presentation slides. All the macros I demoed are also provided. All the images needed for running these macros could be found in the data directory.  

Here is the flyer from the workshop:
