# ImageJ/Fiji Workshop at Mount Sinai
I gave this two-hour workshop at the [Microscopy Core and Advanced Bioimaging Center](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/portal/resources/deans-cores/microscopy) of Icahn School of Medicine in December 2015. 

Creating this repo to put my presentation slides. All the macros I demoed are also provided. Images for running macros 1 and 2 could be found in the "Data" directory.  

Here is the flyer from the workshop:
